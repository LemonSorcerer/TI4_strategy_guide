About

The Lazax Empire has been wiped out of the face of the galaxy. As no race dared face a similar fate, no new ruler came up for the galaxy. This led to the Dark Years which brought an economic, cultural and intellectual decline.

Now, the Dark Years came to an end. The Galactic Council on Mecatol is growing in influence and the Great Races who now expand their empires shall compete for rule of the galaxy.

This document contains information on all the competing factions and strategic advice that will hopefully lead you, the reader, to be the new galactic Emperor, who shall lead the galaxy to a new peaceful and prosperous era.
